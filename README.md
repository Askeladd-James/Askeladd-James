# My personal introduction  

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Xia Mingfei, a new Githuber.  

## edu experience  
I am now a freshman in Shanghaitech UniversityðŸŒ±, and my major is Computer Science.  
I hope to dive into artificial intelligence in the future.  

## personal interest  
I was an athlete in track and field, but 'retired' two years ago.  
Now I engage in the rowing. We have a club in our University, and I usually train once a week.  
We have got a gold last month, thought the competition is not so large and authoritative.  

## personal objective  
I hope to learn more about back-end knowledge, and contact more projects on Github.  

## welcome to contact with me  
My email is ly_xmf@shanghaitech.edu.cn, it's also avilable to see in my personal account profile.  

Thanks a lot, and hope to make progress together with you.
